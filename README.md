# Pokemon_Classification

This is a multi-class classification problem. The objective is to predict the type of the pokemon based on its stats.

Data: In the file data/Pokemon.csv, the relevant data for 634 Pokemon can be found. The column to be used as an output, is Type 1.

I explored the data and performed visualization. I did extensive feature engineering to select important features. I handled missing values, detected outliers and extended base models with polynomial features, gaussian features and Regression splines.
